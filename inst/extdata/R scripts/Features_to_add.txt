Rename package to something less personal than "proteoCraft"!!! Ideas?

 - Display cystein carbamidomethylation (and other fixed mods, incl. TMT or other labeling) for MaxQuant input

 - For pull-downs, statistical tests (except double F-tests) should be made single-tailed

 - Implement Pepper correction for replicates script

 - Add support for SILAC

 - Speedup GO enrich using function clusterprofiler's buildGOmap to get indirect annotations

 - Add GO gene-set enrichment analysis (see https://yulab-smu.top/biomedical-knowledge-mining-book/clusterprofiler-go.html )

 - Add option to skip whole proteins part to just process as peptides (including not just modified but unmodified)

 - Improve ROI analysis

 - Add support for Reactome enrichment analysis

 - Reg. analysis: rename as:
	- "DEP analysis" by default
	- "Interaction analysis" for Pull Down?

 - SAINTexpress: map results to protein groups, create filters

 - PG_assemble:
	Speed optimize the following steps
	- Applying Occam's razor.
	- Getting sequence coverage.
	- Getting Gene and Protein names, diverse annotations...
	It should be possible to be quite faster with aggregate... maybe?
