Label,DIA,"Accepted values are ""LFQ"", ""TMT"" or ""iTRAQ"" for a MQ evidence table; ""DIA"" for a DIA-NN report; for a PD PSM table, ""LFQ"" for label-free, but for isobaric labels we require more precision: ""TMT0plex"", ""TMT2plex"", ""TMT6to11plex"", ""iodoTMT0plex"", ""iodoTMT6plex"", ""aminoxyTMT0plex"", ""aminoxyTMT6plex"", ""iTRAQ4plex"" or ""iTRAQ8plex"" are accepted values; I will eventually want to add SILAC too!"

F.test_within,Exp,What are the F.test groups within which we should work?
F.test_factors,Con_;__;_Rep,"Within each group, what are the factor groups to perform the F.test for? The formalism is a bit complex. We will talk of analyses. For each analysis, there is one first group of main factors, a second optional of secondary ones, and a third optional of blocking factors. Analyses should be separated by ""_|_"", and for each groups (up to three) separated by ""_;_"".Thus, an analysis specified as ""fact1___fact2_;_fact3___fact4_;_fact5"" would first make the contrasts for all combinations of fact1-fact2, then secondary contrasts for all combinations of fact3-fact4, and use fact5 as blocking factor. As another example, ""fact1_;_fact2___fact3_|_fact2_;_fact1___fact3"" would mean that two analyses are made: one with main = fact1 and secondaries = fact 2 and fact 3, and one with main = fact3 and secondaries = fact 1 and fact 3 (no blocking factor)."
