NB:
These parameter files are relatively old.
A few things have changed*, so use with caution, using as basis more recent parameter files - which are anyway now interactively created in shiny apps so do not need normally manual editing.

* A few notable changes:
 - Parameter "Evidence" is now called "PSMs" and for DIA-NN is ignored, since the file name and path are directly detected from the log.txt.
 - Proteome Discoverer support is now probably largely broken, and would likely require some extensive rewrites of the early section.
