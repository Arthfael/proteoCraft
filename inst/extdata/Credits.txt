Some resources in this folder are not created by us but re-distributed with this package for convenience:

 - CCP_cRAPome.fasta is the contaminants fasta file from the Cambridge Center for Proteomics, with headers edited to be more UniProtKB-like.

 - contaminants.fasta is the contaminants fasta file distributed with MaxQuant.

 - mzML_pressure_to_csv.py is re-distributed from https://gist.github.com/caetera
   This can be a very useful way to get pressure profiles from mzML-converted MS files (most utilities focus on MS-level rather than LC-level data extraction).

 - All python files in the /Pepper subdirectory are re-distributed from https://github.com/Noble-Lab/Pepper
   The Pepper scripts on github contain test dataset-specific information hard-coded into the scripts, so need adapting before they can be run dynamically on our scripts.
   Rather than modifying the original scripts, the original scripts re-distributed with the package are automatically editted to match our input dataset.
   (In addition, a very minor bug is also fixed.)
   The idea is that:
	- we can either train the model on our current dataset - which with parallelisation is actually not too terribly slow,
	- or we can re-load an existing model's weights and transfer it to your current dataset.
   Ultimately, the intensity values of compatible peptides (those without modifications used for estimations of absolute protein abundance) will be adjusted by a factor correcting for systematic detectability effects.
   This will make absolute/inter protein comparisons more reliable (solving what I call the apples-and-oranges problem of proteomics).
   At this stage this works but integration into the main workflows is still work-in-progress.

 - Uniprot2AGI.txt is redistributed from https://www.arabidopsis.org/download_files/Proteins/Id_conversions/Uniprot2AGI.txt
   It is bundled with the package for easier mappings between TAIR and UniProtKB identifiers.

 - All Excel macros in .../Nikla's_Excel_macros_(retired) were written by Niklas Kampleitner, our former technician and a talented Excel user.
	o sequ_color_only_VBA.xlsm and sequ_color_only_VBS.vbs: color observed amino acids in green in a column of protein sequences.
	o copy_column_VBA.xlsm and copy_column_VBS.vbs: this was used to duplicate an Excel column including formatting incompatible with openxlsx (the one created by sequ_color_only), to save on time.
	o Format_as_bar_VBA.xlsm and Format_as_bar_VBS.vbs: format values as progress bars.
	o Format_as_num_VBA.xlsm and Format_as_num_VBS.vbs: format values as numeric, where openxlsx was refusing/failing to do so.
	o ExampleCodeForMacros.Rmd illustrates how the macros can be run.
   Though very useful in their time, these were slow. As of July 2024, these are completely superseded by a much faster openxlsx2-based solution.

 - NCBI_GENOME_REPORTS_overview.txt is redistributed from NCBI, downloaded from ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/GENOME_REPORTS/overview.txt on 2024-07-15.
   It is currently used by the Prot.Ruler function by default.


Note that here and there the package's code re-uses small functions gleaned from Stackoverflow or similar forums.
Whilst it would be impossible to credit every anonymous hero whose reply contributed one small step on this long road, wherever possible I have added a comment in the code with a link to the relevant thread.
