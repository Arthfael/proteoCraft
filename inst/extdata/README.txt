Here are a variety of files used by the workflow at different stages, some of which are re-distributed from other packaged. Folder <b>R scripts</b> contains all non-function R code, including:
 - the main analysis workflows,
 - smaller sources (typically shared codes) which are run by the former,
 - and some additional utility scripts (which will need a more cautious approach if you want to use them - think of them as templates rather than mature scripts).
