F.test_factors,,"Within each group, what are the factor groups to perform the F.test for? The formalism is a bit complex. We will talk of analyses. For each analysis, there is one first group of main factors, a second optional of secondary ones, and a third optional of blocking factors. Analyses should be separated by ""_|_"", and for each groups (up to three) separated by ""_;_"".Thus, an analysis specified as ""fact1___fact2_;_fact3___fact4_;_fact5"" would first make the contrasts for all combinations of fact1-fact2, then secondary contrasts for all combinations of fact3-fact4, and use fact5 as blocking factor. As another example, ""fact1_;_fact2___fact3_|_fact2_;_fact1___fact3"" would mean that two analyses are made: one with main = fact1 and secondaries = fact 2 and fact 3, and one with main = fact3 and secondaries = fact 1 and fact 3 (no blocking factor)."
